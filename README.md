## Introduction: 
A knowledge graph represents knowledge through a semantic graph structure, offering a structured way to organize and analyze information. When dealing with unstructured data, challenges such as information extraction, accuracy assurance, and establishing meaningful relationships between entities arise. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, a pivotal historical event, presents a vast amount of information available through various sources, including newspaper articles, books, and personal accounts. Constructing a knowledge graph for this event using newspaper articles can provide a structured representation of the knowledge, simplifying data querying and analysis.

The primary objective of this project is to create a comprehensive knowledge graph of the Bangladesh Liberation War by extracting and organizing information from newspaper articles. This process involves several key steps: preprocessing the articles, extracting relevant entities and relationships, and constructing the graph using appropriate tools and techniques. The final knowledge graph aims to facilitate historical research, education, and the preservation of the rich history of the Liberation War.
